How to do a writeup:

- use latex for the writeup.  No need to do acm templates - just use \documentclass{article} instead of \documentclass{acm_proc_article.sp}
- summarize each paper you read.
- if a paper was awesome or irrelevant, say so and why.
- cite your sources (for traceability) using the same bibtex files you plan on using for the final report.
